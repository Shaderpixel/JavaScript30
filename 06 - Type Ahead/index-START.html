<!--
Lesson Learnt:
-Fetch is a new browser technology which is a new browser API,
-Somewhat similar to a HTML or XML HTTP request in the browser like jQuery $.getJSON
-Fetch is not similar to getJSON in the sense that you don't perform a callback function on the returned data, Fetch returns a promise that something will eventually be fetched
-then() method works with what is returned and the data needs to be converted into a usable format e.g. blob to JSON, jpg, wav
-blob has a prototype for json which will return another promise
-const doesn't allow a redeclaring or reassigning of the same constant
-spread ES6 operator is the three ellipsis that lets you spread out iterable objects
-if we just push(data), it will be added as a single item, but if we spread data out and add it one by one it will be turned into an actual array when added to cities
-change event only triggers when the element loses focus while input event triggers immediately, immitate input event by combining change event with keyup event
-when using named functions in callbacks don't use parentheses otherwise it will be called immediately. Without the parentheses, it is just a reference to the named function so that it will becalled when the callback is used
-array.prototype.join(['separator']), joins all elements of an array into a string
